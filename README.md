# Heart-Attack-Prediction-Part2
This repository is a continuation of my work from my graduate class DSE6111, where I used predictive models to predict heart attacks, and test each models accuracy. In this repository, I switch to Python from R and test some other advanced models including a couple different neural networks from sklearn and pytorch.
